The spreader HLs project is used to generate the HDL for spreading task, which is wrapped into a CE to plug into the RFNoC framework.
To conform with the requirements of an RFNoC block, axi stream input and output interfaces are used. Input parameter pn_seq_len is connected to a settings register. The spreader takes in data symbols in SC16 format(signed complex numbers with 16 bit real and imaginary parts) and spreads them using a real PN sequence giving L SC16 output symbols for each input, where L is the sequence length. The PN sequence is locally by a [PN sequence generator](../pn_seq_gen_lfsr/README.md)
