#Correlator

The correlator module built using this project, continuously correlates incoming samples with a locally generated PN sequence and gives correlation power as the output. Two parallel correlator structures as shown below are used to process real and imaginary parts of the incoming samples. 

Shift register sample storage and parallel adders are generated by using

_#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION_

with each of the data storage and sum variables.

Binary adder tree is implemented by unrolling each of the adder stages using

 _#pragma HLS UNROLL_
